If you have some familiarity with any dataframe library, most of the examples should make sense, but if you’re familiar with Pandas they’ll make even more sense because all the Polars code is accompanied by the equivalent Pandas code.\nYou don’t need to have read Modern Pandas, though I of course think it’s a great read.",

    "text": "Why?\nThere’s this weird phenomenon where people write data programming code as if they hate themselves. Many of them are academic or quant types who seem to have some complex about being “bad at coding”. Armchair psychology aside, lots of clever folk keep doing really dumb stuff with Pandas, and at some point you have to wonder if the Pandas API is too difficult for its users.\nAt the very least, articles like Minimally Sufficient Pandas make a compelling case for Pandas having too much going on.\nHaving used Pandas a lot, I think Polars is more intuitive and does a better job of having One Obvious Way to do stuff. It’s also much faster at most things, even when you do Pandas the right way.\nHopefully this work shows you how, why and when to prefer Polars.",

This isn’t just me being lazy - I want to draw on Pandas examples that quite a lot of people are already familiar with.\nSo credit goes to Tom for the Pandas examples, for most of the data fetching code and for the general structure of the articles. Meanwhile the text content and the Polars examples are from me.",
